# OpenWebNet parser for Python

This is a Python library to connect and parse OpenWebNet messages from Bticino/Legrand gateways.

Currently it's a WIP, but it's already able to connect to the gateway and parse some messages.

## What is OpenWebNet?

OpenWebNet is a home automation protocol developed by Bticino (now part of Legrand) to control domotic devices like lights, shutters, heating, etc.
It was developed around 2000 and it's still used today in many installations.
It does not implement any encryption, so it's not secure to use it over the internet.
Also many devices implement only the old password algorithm, which is easily bruteforceable.
So, when using OpenWebNet, be sure to use it only in a trusted network and taking security measures, like vlan separation.
